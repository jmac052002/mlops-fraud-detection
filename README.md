# MLOps Fraud Detection Pipeline

An end-to-end MLOps pipeline on AWS that automates the full lifecycle of a fraud detection model from raw data ingestion through training, evaluation, quality gating, model registration, deployment, and monitoring. All infrastructure is defined as code using AWS CloudFormation.

---

## Architecture
```
New CSV uploaded to S3
        ↓
EventBridge detects upload → triggers Lambda
        ↓
Lambda starts SageMaker Pipeline
        ↓
PreprocessData → TrainModel → EvaluateModel → CheckModelQuality → RegisterModel
        ↓
Pipeline completes → Monitoring Lambda fires
        ↓
Model metrics published to CloudWatch + Email alert sent via SNS
        ↓
Registered model deployed to SageMaker Endpoint
        ↓
Model Monitor baseline watches for data drift
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Deploy all infrastructure
```bash
bash infrastructure/deploy.sh
```
This validates and deploys all three CloudFormation stacks in the correct order.

### 3. Run the pipeline
```bash
python src/pipeline/sagemaker_pipeline.py
```

### 4. Test the S3 trigger
```bash
aws s3 cp data/raw/creditcard.csv \
  s3://mlops-fraud-detection-dev-584996267165/raw/creditcard_test.csv
```

### 5. Deploy the endpoint
```bash
python src/deployment/deploy_endpoint.py
```

## Model Performance

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| F1 Score | 0.1111 |
| Precision | 0.0593 |
| Recall | 0.8784 |
| ROC-AUC | 0.9612 |

> High recall is the design goal catching 88% of fraud cases is more valuable than avoiding false positives in this domain.

## Monitoring & Alerting

- **Pipeline alerts:** SNS email on every pipeline success or failure
- **Model metrics:** F1, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC published to CloudWatch `MLOps/FraudDetection` namespace after every run
- **Data drift:** Model Monitor baseline established from training data constraints and statistics saved to S3
